# Linear Regression with PyTorch

## Introduction
This program demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model using PyTorch. It uses a generated dataset with sklearn to predict a dependent variable (y) based on an independent variable (x). The model is trained using gradient descent to minimize the mean squared error (MSE).

### Libraries to import: 
```
import torch                        #pytorch library - for for tensor computations
import torch.nn as nn               #for building neural networks
import numpy as np                  #numerical data manipulation
from sklearn import datasets        #To generate and load datasets
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt     #for creating visualizations
```
