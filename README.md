[Linear Regression with PyTorch]

This program demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model using PyTorch. It uses a synthetic dataset generated with sklearn.datasets to predict a dependent variable (y) based on an independent variable (x). The model is trained using gradient descent to minimize the mean squared error (MSE).
